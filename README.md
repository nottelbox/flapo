# flaschenpost SE - IT Exercise Task #6

## Requirements
.NET 9 and Node.js are required, because I chose an ASP.NET Application as backend Service and a react App as Webapp. URLs are hardcoded for local execution.

## How to start?
- clone the git repo
- open Backend solution with Visual Studio or Jetbrains Rider and start the application
- execute in frontend directory:
- npm install
- npm run dev
- visit localhost:5173 in your browser (Vite default port)
